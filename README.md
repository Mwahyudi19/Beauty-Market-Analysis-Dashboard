# 💄 Beauty & Cosmetics Market Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 15,000 beauty and cosmetic products to uncover market trends, consumer preferences, and competitive landscape insights using **Microsoft Power BI**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to transform raw product data into an interactive dashboard to support strategic decision-making in product development and marketing. The analysis focuses on:

- **Market Segmentation:** Analyzing price distribution across **Budget, Mid-Range, and Luxury** segments.
- **Consumer Preferences:** Correlating **Ratings & Reviews** with product categories, skin types, and key ingredients.
- **Ethical & Ingredient Trends:** Evaluating the market share of **Cruelty-Free** products and the popularity of active ingredients (e.g., Retinol, Vitamin C).

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used (`most_used_beauty_cosmetics_products_extended.csv`) contains **15,000 records** with the following key attributes:
- **Product Info:** Brand, Category, Price (USD), Product Size.
- **Consumer Data:** User Ratings, Review Counts, Usage Frequency.
- **Targeting:** Skin Type, Gender Target.
- **Product Details:** Main Ingredient, Packaging Type, Cruelty-Free Status, Country of Origin.

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflow

The entire analysis workflow was conducted in **Microsoft Power BI**:

1.  **Data Transformation (Power Query):**
    - Cleaned and standardized raw data.
    - Created conditional columns for **Price Segmentation** (Budget < $50, Mid-Range $50-$100, Luxury > $100).
    - Extracted numerical volume data for price-per-ml analysis.

2.  **Visualization:**
    - **Executive Overview:** KPI Cards and Map Charts for global distribution.
    - **Market Analysis:** Donut Charts for Cruelty-Free analysis and Bar Charts for category performance.
    - **Deep Dive:** Scatter Plots (Price vs. Rating).
  
## 📈 Key Insights

- **Cruelty-Free Market:** The market is evenly split (~50/50) between cruelty-free and non-cruelty-free products, indicating that ethical standards are becoming a baseline expectation rather than a niche differentiator.
- **Price vs. Quality:** Analysis suggests a weak correlation between high prices and high user ratings, highlighting opportunities for budget-friendly high-quality products.
